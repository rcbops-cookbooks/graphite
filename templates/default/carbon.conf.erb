# Configure carbon directories.
#
# OS environment variables can be used to tell carbon where graphite is
# installed, where to read configuration from and where to write data.
#
#   GRAPHITE_ROOT        - Root directory of the graphite installation.
#                          Defaults to ../
#   GRAPHITE_CONF_DIR    - Configuration directory (where this file lives).
#                          Defaults to $GRAPHITE_ROOT/conf/
#   GRAPHITE_STORAGE_DIR - Storage directory for whipser/rrd/log/pid files.
#                          Defaults to $GRAPHITE_ROOT/storage/
#
# To change other directory paths, add settings to this file. The following
# configuration variables are available with these default values:

# the files quickly but at the risk of slowing I/O down considerably for a while.

# NOTE: you cannot run both a cache and a relay on the same server
# with the default configuration, you have to specify a distinict
# interfaces and ports for the listeners.

# In these chef recipes, we assume that a node will be either
# a relay OR a cache, not both.  Therefore, we will set the
# relay ports and interfaces to the same ip/port settings as the
# cache.

# NOTE: currently there is no logic for correctly setting the
# CACHE_SERVERS attribute.  If you want to build a hierarchical
# setup with this, you will need to hard code the template, or
# make the recipe smarter.  Patches accepted!
